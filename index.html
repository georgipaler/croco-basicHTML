      <p>Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics
        in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. </p>
      <h1>Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily.</h1>
      <h2> A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term
        crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae.</h2>
      <h3>The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes
        the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae), and all other
        living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.</h3>

            Crocodile size, morphology,
            behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species.         However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. 
                       All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers,
            
            lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater.
